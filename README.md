# Welcome to Relay

This is the api for the Relay mobile app. 

Relay is Canada’s first ridesharing mobile app for parents, designed to make it easy to arrange safe and reliable transportation for your children. Whether you’re a busy parent juggling a hectic schedule or a new immigrant seeking to expand your network, Relay connects you with trusted families in your community—no random drivers. Parents can share the driving load, save time, and reduce stress by connecting with others from school or activity groups. With real-time GPS tracking, AI ride updates, and smart route matching, Relay simplifies carpooling, helping both parents and kids build social bonds while ensuring a safe, stress-free ride.
